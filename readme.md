- **Internet connection** for first-time setup (downloads dependencies)

### Option 1: Automatic Setup (Recommended)

```
1. Download or clone this repository
2. Double-click SETUP.bat
3. Done! J.A.R.V.I.S installs all dependencies and launches automatically.
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/morphhyyy-cpu/ULTRON.git
cd J.A.R.V.I.S
python JARVIS_SETUP.py
```

### Option 3: Step-by-Step Manual

## First Launch

On the very first launch, J.A.R.V.I.S will ask for your **Gemini API Key**.

1. Get a free key at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
2. Paste it when prompted, or edit `config/api_keys.json` manually
3. If your selected interpreter is Python 3.13+ or 3.14, skip the optional wake-word `PyAudio` dependency. Use Python 3.10-3.12 for the wake service, or install the Visual C++ Build Tools and retry `pip install pyaudio`.

## Wake Word (Hands-Free Activation)

To keep J.A.R.V.I.S listening in the background:

- Double-click **`Start_JARVIS_Wake_Word.bat`**
- Say **"Wake up J.A.R.V.I.S"** or **"Hey J.A.R.V.I.S"** to activate

## How Sharing Works

This project is **fully portable** -- no hardcoded paths.

**To share J.A.R.V.I.S with someone:**

1. Push this repo to GitHub (or send as ZIP)
2. Recipient clones/extracts to ANY folder on their PC
3. They double-click `SETUP.bat` (or run `python JARVIS_SETUP.py`)
4. Everything installs automatically
5. J.A.R.V.I.S launches and works immediately

**The setup script automatically:**
- Verifies all project files are present
- Downloads missing files from GitHub if needed
- Installs all Python packages (PyQt6, sounddevice, google-genai, etc.)
- Installs Playwright Chromium browser engine
- Creates default configuration files
- Provides manual download links if auto-download fails

---

## Requirements

All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` and installed automatically by the setup script:

- PyQt6 + PyQt6-WebEngine
- sounddevice, PyAudio, SpeechRecognition
- google-genai, google-generativeai
- playwright, requests, beautifulsoup4
- numpy, opencv-python, pillow
- psutil, pyautogui, pyperclip
- fastapi, uvicorn, cryptography
- And more (see requirements.txt)
